# Qiskit by IBM

In this repository we will look into IBM-Qiskit. The goal
here is to provide introduction to it features, go through
the basic tutorials and then eventually try to code some
quantum algorithms using IBM-qiskit. From now on we will 
refer IBM-Qiskit as just "qiskit".

To this end we will learn 3 main things 

1. How to install qiskit and its basic features.
2. Basic quantum-mechanical operations on qubits.
3. Learn 20 quantum-algorithms to get intuition into
    building quantum-algorithms.

Happy qiskitting.
